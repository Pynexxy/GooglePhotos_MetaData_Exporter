# Google Photos Metadata Implementation for Media Files

This solution provides a set of functions to implement metadata in media files exported from Google Photos. The functions enable the retrieval and insertion of metadata to enhance the organization and management of the media files.

## Overview

The solution consists of several functions that facilitate the implementation of metadata in media files. These functions handle tasks such as renaming files, organizing files by format, searching for specific files, converting filenames to lowercase, executing commands in folders, and changing file extensions. The functions included in this toolkit are:

1. `generate_file_mapping(folder_path)`: Generates a file mapping of the files in the specified folder and its subfolders.

2. `rename_files_in_directory(directory)`: Renames files in a directory based on a specific pattern.

3. `replace_dotdot_filenames(directory)`: Replaces ".." in filenames with "." in a directory and its subdirectories.

4. `remove_last_character(folder_path)`: Removes the last character from filenames ending with ".json" in a folder and its subfolders.

5. `delete_screenshot_files(directory)`: Deletes screenshot files in a directory and its subdirectories.

6. `organize_media_files(root_directory)`: Organizes multimedia files in a root directory by their file formats.

7. `search_and_move_files(root_directory)`: Searches for specific files in subdirectories and moves them to corresponding folders.

8. `convert_to_lowercase(folder)`: Converts the filenames in a folder to lowercase.

9. `execute_commands_in_folders(folder_list)`: Executes specific commands within folders and saves the command output.

10. `change_extension(file_name)`: Changes the file extension of a file to a different format.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure that Python is installed on your system.

2. Download the file management toolkit code files.

3. Import the necessary modules and functions from the toolkit into your Python script.

4. Use the provided functions to implement metadata in your media files exported from Google Photos.

## Example Usage

Here's an example that demonstrates how to use the functions in this toolkit for implementing metadata in media files exported from Google Photos:

```python
import os
from file_management_toolkit import (
    generate_file_mapping,
    rename_files_in_directory,
    replace_dotdot_filenames,
    remove_last_character,
    delete_screenshot_files,
    organize_media_files,
    search_and_move_files,
    convert_to_lowercase,
    execute_commands_in_folders,
    change_extension
)

# Step 1: Export media files from Google Photos to a local directory

google_photos_folder = "/path/to/google/photos/folder"
exported_files_folder = "/path/to/exported/files/folder"

# Code to export media files from Google Photos to the exported_files_folder

# Step 2: Implement metadata for the exported files

# Renaming files based on a specific pattern
rename_files_in_directory(exported_files_folder)

# Replacing ".." in filenames with "."
replace_dotdot_filenames(exported_files_folder)

# Removing the last character from filenames ending with ".json"
remove_last_character(exported_files_folder)

# Deleting screenshot files
delete_screenshot_files(exported_files_folder)

# Organizing media files by file formats
organize_media_files(exported_files_folder)

# Searching for specific files and moving them to corresponding folders
search_and_move_files(exported_files_folder)

# Converting filenames to lowercase
convert_to_lowercase(exported_files_folder)

# Executing specific commands within folders
folder_list = [exported_files_folder]
execute_commands_in_folders(folder_list)

# Changing file extensions to a different format
change_extension("example_file.heic")
```

Please note that you may need to adapt and customize the provided code snippets to fit your specific requirements and file management workflow.
